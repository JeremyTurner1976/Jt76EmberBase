I hope to be able to include several create.js built video games, as well as a GeoGroup project.

To top it off, each group will have their own dedicated message board. Just something to make 3 car journeys that much easier to handle, and it never hurts when playing a game of tag.\r\n        <hr class=\"jt76-hr-md\" />\r\n\r\n        <br />\r\n\r\n        <div class=\"user-widget\">\r\n            <div class=\"user-widget-body bg-light-grey border-info\">\r\n                <img alt=\"\" src=\"/Content/Images/Jt76EmberBase/developer.jpg\">\r\n                <div class=\"user-detail\">\r\n                    <div class=\"m-top-sm\">Jeremy Turner</div>\r\n                    <div class=\"small-text text-success\">Software Engineer</div>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"user-widget-statatistic\">\r\n                <ul class=\"clearfix\">\r\n                    <li class=\"border-red\">\r\n                        <div class=\"text-muted text-upper font-sm\">C# Code</div>\r\n                        ~35k lines\r\n                    </li>\r\n                    <li class=\"border-green\">\r\n                        <div class=\"text-muted text-upper font-sm\">JavaScript Code</div>\r\n                        ~20k lines\r\n                    </li>\r\n                    <li class=\"border-yellow\">\r\n                        <div class=\"text-muted text-upper font-sm\">Production Apps</div>\r\n                        3\r\n                    </li>\r\n                </ul>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n";
